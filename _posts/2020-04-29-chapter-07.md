<h2>The Group Facilitator</h2>

The group facilitator is a member of the group who has (preferrably) worked through his or her own narratives in group therapy. This background is beneficial not only because this person has some insight into their own life and can have a balancing role in the role, but also because he or she has experienced narrative group therapy first-hand and can assist others to learn the narrative group process. 

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

The group facilitator is responsible for:
<ul>
<li>beginning and ending each session</li>
<li>ensuring that conversations do not overwhelm group members - stopping conversations when individuals seem overwhelmed or struggling unduly</li>
<li>ensuring that participants are given time, when needed, to regroup emotionally after a difficult session</li>
<li>asking and confirming with group members that they are not in distress when beginning with the group and ensuring that they have a care plan, as needed</li>
<li>discussing any difficult issues (within confidentiality requirements) with consulting supervision</li>
</ul>

These are significant responsibilities and narrative facilitators should be adequately trained for the role.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

Group facilitators are not traditional mental health practitioners and they are not expected to make mental health diagnoses when members enter or are in the narrative group.
