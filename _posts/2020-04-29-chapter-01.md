<h2>Your Safety</h2>

If you feel emotionally fragile, you are worried about your mental well-being or you have historical reasons to be concerned about your mental health, always have a support system and care plan in place before beginning something new that involves exploring your mind or self-help. Have others who can help you nearby and have a plan for how you will respond if things get difficult.

<h2>Scope of Exploration</h2>

Not all topics will be suitable for exploration within group therapy, especially if the facilitator is inexperienced. Take things slowly with your group, learning to interact together. If you feel uncomfortable sharing something, donâ€™t. You are in charge of what parts of yourself you share with the group.

<h2>Duty of Care</h2>

If you are facilitating the group or are otherwise involved with the well-being of others in the group, you have a responsibility to care for others, including but not limited to protecting their confidentiality, providing emotional support during distress in the group (including calling in professionals, when necessary) and respecting the boundaries of others.

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>

This has been mentioned, but is extremely important. What happens in the group stays in the group. Do not betray others by sharing outside of the group. However, the group should clearly understand that when the group facilitator has supervision, he or she will share any topics with supervisors to ensure that group members are helped or to help the facilitator deal with his or her own issues arising from group sessions.
