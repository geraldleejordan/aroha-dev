<h2>Level of Training</h2>

At a minimum, a narrative group facilitator needs to have completed a course in Narrative Therapy. Ideally, she or he will also have been through group narrative, working through personal issues with others. This combination of theory and experience will help to ensure that the facilitator is adequately prepared to help others. 

One possibility is training in group narratives that not only introduces the theory of Narrative Therapy, but which also involves group therapy sessions for trainee facilitators. That is, a group of trainee facilitator studying theory in (say) morning sessions and then being part of group narrative work for their own issues in afternoon sessions. 

This training should be a minimal requirement for narrative group facilitators.

<h2>Continuing Education</h2>

Continuing education opportunities include supervision, online group therapy work for facilitators and other opportunities. The goal is to allow facilitators to up-skill and seek assistance, without creating yet another entrenched professional body.
