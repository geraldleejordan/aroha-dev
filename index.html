<p><i>We may define therapy as a search for value.</i> ~Abraham Maslow</p>
  
  <h2>My Motivation to Create These Resources</h2>  
  
<p>I have a passion for helping others - especially those in distress. I come from a line of helpers and this is part of who I am. I have also experienced my own distress and suffered while looking for support. I was able to find it it family, but realised that I wanted to become a counsellor to help others who were also suffering.</p>
  
  <h2>Problems with Current Therapy Delivery</h2>  

<p>I have been both a therapist and a client. The most difficult things about therapy from my perspective? It is too hard to access. It is too expensive for individual sessions. It has not been normalized for most of society. It is the option of a privileged few. This content attempts to help with these issues. They wonâ€™t be resolved in a single attempt, but standard therapy offerings need to become wider than the 19th Century model favored by those wealthy enough to afford it.</p>
  
  <h2>Control Common in Therapy</h2>  
  
<p>Most therapeutic models are directive, with the therapist having the central role of expert. Behind this is a value system of what is well and what is considered deviant or otherwise unacceptable. Most of these systems have been devised by (predominately white) men of the dominant culture - often well intending, perhaps, but nonetheless promoting their own views and values of normality.</p>
  
  <h2>Emphasising Narrative Therapy</h2>  
  
<p>Narrative Therapy stands out from this, as the client is the expert and the role of the therapist is a decentered one. Within this space, the client is meant to lead the way, looking for those things most of value to self. The therapist asks questions to explore the dominant narratives and those things (events, ideas and other possibilities) which do not fit the dominant narratives. This supporting role of the therapist opens many doors for changes not only to the traditional authority of the therapist, but to the role more generally of the therapist in the encounter. This book explores the possibility for the therapist to step back yet further - from a central questioning role - to one of a facilitator, modelling the facilitation role for others in the group, with the goal of others in the group learning skills that can be used both within the group and which they can then apply outside of the group within their own lives.</p>
